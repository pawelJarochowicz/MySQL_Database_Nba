# MySQL_Database_Nba
Creating very simple MySQL Database using JDBC

Database has a six tables
* coach
* coach_stats
* player
* player_stats
* team
* team_stats

It contains only 10 teams(BOS, CLE, DAL, DEN, GSW, LAL, PHI, PHX, TOR, UTH)
It has not been finished. Still needs a records for a tables: team_stats, player_stats.
For example there're stats like wins_rating (from 0 to 100).
Stats from his database will be used for a future app ;)
See you soon :)
